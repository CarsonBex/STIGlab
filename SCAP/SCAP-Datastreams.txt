SCAP datastreams are bundled packages of multiple SCAP components, 
including the benchmark, XCCDF, OVAL, CPE, Fix Content, and metadata information. They 
are what tell SCAP Workbench what to check, how to check it, and how to fix it.
For the purpose of this home lab, I chose to use unsigned SCAP datastreams from the
ComplianceAsCode github repo.

Commands to set up a ComplianceAsCode datastream goes as follows;

sudo dnf install cmake make gcc git python3 libxslt-devel openscap-utils python3-jinja2 scap-workbench -y
git clone https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content.git
cd content/build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)

After this completes, you will have a file in your content/build/ directory
that you can use in SCAP Workbench to scan your system for STIG compliance, select specific security profiles,
and generate detailed HTML reports for analysis or remediation tracking!
